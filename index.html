			<h2>Matching Pennies</h2>
			<p>
				Let's play a game. You and your opponent (the computer) have coins, and the two of you will flip your coins at the same time. You win a point if both coins land on the same side (both coins could land Heads, for example). Your opponent wins otherwise.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both you and your opponent are allowed to pick the bias of your coin. For the first game, your opponent picks a bias first. <i>You can see the bias of your opponent's coin before you make your move, so pick your bias wisely.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				After you pick your bias, our simulator will run a 100 coin tosses, and will output your score at the end.
